## Project Overview

This project implements a secure authentication system using JWT. It showcases the integration of a React frontend with a Node.js/Express.js backend to provide user registration, login, and protected route access.

## What I Learned

- Implementing **JWT-based authentication** in a full-stack application.
- Creating and validating **JSON Web Tokens** on the server-side.
- Securing routes in an **Express.js** backend using middleware.
- Managing authentication state in a **React** frontend application.
- Handling token storage and transmission securely between frontend and backend.
- Implementing protected routes in React using **React Router**.
- Deploying both frontend and backend applications on **Vercel**.

This project demonstrates the practical application of modern web security practices in a real-world scenario, showcasing the power and flexibility of JWT for maintaining user sessions and securing API endpoints.
